# FindMy
Query Apple's Find My network, based on all the hard work of https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/ and others.

## Install and Run
To install just clone this repo, to run a Mac (real or virtual) and an Apple ID are required

1. (Optional, if you don't have a MAC and/or Apple ID): Generate an Apple ID, and instal the Catalina Pre-installed docker image from https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX#run-catalina-pre-installed-, and login to iCloud using your AppleID
2. Add your public keys to `request_reports.sh` at the top, and run (only internal tools are used, no dependencies)

Soon this script will be fully in python, no need to keep a python script and a shell script interacting. I learn while doing.
